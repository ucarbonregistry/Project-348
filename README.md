0.844 MW Solar Power Project by M/s MicroTech Rollers Pvt. Ltd

The proposed project titled under UCR is “0.844 MW Solar Power Project by M/s MicroTech Rollers
Pvt. Ltd.”, which is a grid connected solar power project. The purpose of this project is to generate clean
energy. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s MicroTech Rollers Pvt. Ltd.’ (herein after called as
Project Proponent or PP). PP has the full ownership of the project activity. This project is an operational
activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry”
(UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 0.844 MW is installed at Upleta taluka in
Rajkot district in the state of Gujarat.

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 1,478.68 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. For the solar power project, wheeling agreement is signed
between MicroTech Rollers Pvt. Ltd. and PGVCL (Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited) The project
activities use Polycrystalline solar photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. The generation of
power from solar photovoltaic is a clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are
emitted during the process. Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by
circuits and sealed in an environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building
blocks of the complete PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV
Array. Thus, project activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuelbased electricity generation in the regional grid. The technological details have been provided in Section

Since the project activity generates electricity through solar energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
